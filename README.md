# Binary Trees and Lowest Common Ancestors in Rust
Note: the tree should work for any data type with `trait PartialOrd` and `trait Copy`, and is tested for most standard primitive numeric types like `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `f32` and `f64`.
#### Steps to test:
* Download and install Rust and Cargo as described [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
* Open a terminal to the repo directory.
* In the terminal, run `cargo test` to view test results.
